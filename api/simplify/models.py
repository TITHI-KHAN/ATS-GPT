            For the given sentence: "{text}", perform the following tasks:

            1. Identify **all** complex or less common words and provide their simpler synonyms.
            2. Provide a **lexical simplification** of the sentence by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms, ensuring to simplify as many words as possible without altering the meaning.
            3. Provide a **sentence paraphrase** that conveys the same meaning in simpler, more straightforward terms.
            4. Provide a **syntactic simplification** by breaking down complex sentence structures into simpler ones.
            5. Provide a **syntactic and lexical simplification** by applying both sentence structure simplification and word replacement.
